# AnimatedCrack
 
This Unity v 2021 project extends a shader made by Gabriel A., by adding time-based noise to look like lava.  It also uses a crack that uses bones and thus is a SkinnedMeshRenderer in Unity. There are a bunch of bones used to animate the "arms" of the crack.  A special script is used to update the colliders and another script is used to trigger any objects near the edge to fall into the crack whenever the (invisible mask top of the) crack is below iit.
